		<p>As mentioned, I love doing a lot of different things in my free time even if that means I'm a bit distracted all the time. Here are a few of the things I do.</p>
		<h2>Gardening</h2>
		I just love the process of growing something. Would I say I have a green thumb? Possibly not since it takes me several tries for plants not to die, but I appreciate the process anyways. I truly believe that it would greatly benefit us to do things with our hands. Gardening is also my way of connecting with the climate activist side of myself. Here's a picture of me with my first ever vegetable successfully planted, a radish!

		<h2>Volunteering</h2>
		I've done a lot of volunteering, mainly in Madison, WI. I have volunteered at the Madison's Children Museum, the Beacon (a place for the unhoused population), and also at Citizens' Climate Lobby. Volunteering is one way I connect with the community around me. Here is a picture of me in front of the white house to do climate lobbying.

		<h2>A conglomerate of things I dub "nerds' heaven"</h2>
		Basically, this mainly includes things like tabletop roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc. In fact, I used to make fantasy terrains for campaigns as shown in the following picture.

		<p>It also includes reading and watching fantasy and science fiction - I am a big fan of Ursula K Le Guin. This is closely related with another hobby I'd like to get back to, creative writing. I just love reading poetry and short stories or novels that invoke in me something I haven't felt before, and creative writing, be it stories, poems, or even fantasy world settings for games, is an outlet for that alongside reading.</p>
		<h2>Others</h2>
		I just love dancing. My favorite type of dance is swing, any kind. I also enjoy ballroom dancing, particularly foxtrot due to its fun rhythm. I frequently go to Badgers' Ballroom Dance Team, and we'll see if I participate in any competition in the future. In an ideal world, I'd be playing the keyboard more as well, not that I'm good at it. I do think it's fun when I don't pressure myself to stick to the score.
