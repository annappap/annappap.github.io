		<p>Here are a few of the things I do when I have time:</p>
		<h2>Gardening</h2>
		<p>I enjoy the process of growing something. Would I say I have a green thumb? Possibly not since it takes me several tries for plants not to die, but I appreciate the process anyways. I truly believe that it would greatly benefit us to do things with our hands. Here's a picture of me with my first ever vegetable successfully planted, a radish!</p>

		<h2>Volunteering</h2>
		<p>Volunteering is one way I connect with the community around me. I've volunteered at the Madison's Children Museum, the Beacon (a facility for the unhoused population), and Citizens' Climate Lobby. Here is a picture of me in front of the white house preparing to do some climate lobbying (first lobbying experience).</p>

		<h2>Your average nerds' stuff</h2>
		<p>This mainly includes things like tabletop roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc. I used to make fantasy terrains for campaigns as shown in the following picture.</p>

		<p>It also includes reading and watching fantasy and science fiction - I am a big fan of Ursula K Le Guin. This is closely related with another hobby I'd like to get back to, creative writing.		<h2>Others</h2>
		<p>I like dancing, almost any kind. My favorite type is swing. I also enjoy ballroom dancing, particularly foxtrot due to its fun rhythm. I frequently go to Badgers' Ballroom Dance Team, and we'll see if I participate in any competition in the future. In an ideal world, I'd be playing the keyboard more, not that I'm good at it. I do think it's fun when I don't pressure myself to stick to the score.</p>
