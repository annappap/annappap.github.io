		<p>I quite enjoy teaching and it's something I want to focus more on during my last few years in my program. I have experience doing peer tutoring in undergrad, and I was a counselor for the Ross Mathematics program during the summer of 2020, during which I learned a lot about my philosophy of teaching math. I enjoy being interactive with my students and guiding them toward thinking more mathematically.</p>
