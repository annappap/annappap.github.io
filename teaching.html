		<p>Even though grading is always its evil concomitant, I quite enjoy teaching - it's something I want to focus more on during my last few years in the program. I have experience doing peer tutoring in undergrad, and I was a counselor for the Ross Mathematics program during the summer of 2020, during which I learned a lot about my philosophy of teaching math..</p>
