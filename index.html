			<p>Hello! I'm Anna Pham, a Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin-Madison.  As you can probably tell, I like the 90s' style of websites. I think it's rather suitable for someone doing computational math.</p>
			<p>My research interest is in computational/applied math, specifically in computational psychiatry. Before my graduate studies, I was an undergrad at University of Texas at 			Dallas.</p>
			<p>I like doing a lot of things in my free time, if I manage to come by those. Gardening, playing TTRPG, dancing are amongst my most popular activities. I'm trying, but always failing to some degree, to be more physically active. My favorite form of exercise is hands down yoga. One day, I'll be able to do crow or handstand, hopefully.</p>
			<p>I share in <a href="https://fardila.com/">Federico Ardilla's axioms.</a></p>
